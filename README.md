Hello my name is Henry I am 14 and I designed an audio vizualizer using the, MEMS digital PDM microphone IM69D120, ESP-32-C3-DevKitM-1 MCU, and Vishay OLED-128O064D-BPP3N00000 Display.

Turns sound into visuals through a 128x64 OLED display!

Attached below are the images of my work.

*note the OLED is not in the screenshots of the finished 3d model as it does not have a 3d model available, and I would have to purchase/create a 3d model. However it does fit, within the case on the PCB as i have measured its dimensions. And no lid is due to this fact, there being no lid is fully intentional.
