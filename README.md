Hello my name is Henry I am 14 and I designed an audio vizualizer using the, MEMS digital PDM microphone IM69D120, ESP-32-C3-DevKitM-1 MCU, and Vishay OLED-128O064D-BPP3N00000 Display.

Turns sound into visuals through a 128x64 OLED display!

Attached below are the images of my work.

The PCB will fit into the case perfectly, allowing for easy accsess to the OLED display, additionally I would like to screw some clear plastic over the top into the case that is why I have left screw-holes in the corners of the case.
