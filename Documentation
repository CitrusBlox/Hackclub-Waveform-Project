I started this project as I thought it would be a good way for me to learn how to work with microcontrollers, and PCB's; aswell as the fact that I could meet fellow engineers.

I started this project December 4th 21:14 and finished December 5th 17:53, however the first 9 hours were spent learning the tools I hadn't used before.
